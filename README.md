# CS-305
Through the analysis of advanced security concepts, students will learn how to develop 
secure code that complies with security testing protocols. In addition to exploring 
and implementing security concepts through code, students will also learn why
and how to apply encryption technologies and techniques to communicate securely.

## Project One (Module Three submission)
Examine Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify security vulnerabilities in 
their current software. In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:
* Analyze how advanced security concepts are applied to develop secure code

## Project Two (Module Seven submission)
Refactor code for Artemis Financial’s current software application to add secure 
communication mechanisms and meet their software  security requirements. In this project, 
you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies:
* Design and implement code that complies with software security testing protocols
* Write secure communications through the application of current encryption technologies and techniques
