# CS-305
Through the analysis of advanced security concepts, students will learn how to develop 
secure code that complies with security testing protocols. In addition to exploring 
and implementing security concepts through code, students will also learn why
and how to apply encryption technologies and techniques to communicate securely.

## REFLECTION
### Summary
<p>Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. We've been asked to examine Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify security vulnerabilities.</p>

### Identifying vulnerabilities and implement secure coding practices
<p>Reviewing the code manually and using the dependency checker revealed several potential vulnerabilities. Using the generated reports and other techniques, I was able to identify solutions to mitigate vulnerabilities or finding alternative methods to accomplish a task in a more secure manner. Succesfully using industry best pracices like implementing inut validation, securing hashing abd encryption, and regularly updating software helps ensure that software implements appropriate security methods.</p>

### Challenges
<p>Some vulnerabilities may not have any known solutions, or may be false positives. It can be challeging to identify these but depending on severity may be safely ignored.</p>

### Assessing risk and identifyig vulnerabilities and appropriate mitigation techniques
<p>It is impoprtant to use appropriate automated and manual tools to identify vulnerabilities. Being able to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and overall risk is a skill that developers need to hone as resource allocation needs to be considered and there may be times that mtigating all known, but relatively insignificant, vulnerabilities may be too costly to puruse.</p>

### Contiuous testing
<p>Testing must occur after each code refactoring to ensure no new vulnerabilities have been introduced. Anytime code is updated, previous testing should be re-run. Using an automated CI/CD processes and automated unit testing ensures that code is both functional and secure.</p>

### Resources and tools discovered
<p>Understanding certificates and Certificate Authorities permits users of sftware to authenticate the source of the data being used. This is vital to developweb-based on cloud deployed applications that are currently in high demand.</p>


## Project One
Examine Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify security vulnerabilities in 
their current software. In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:
* Analyze how advanced security concepts are applied to develop secure code

## Project Two
Refactor code for Artemis Financial’s current software application to add secure 
communication mechanisms and meet their software  security requirements. In this project, 
you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies:
* Design and implement code that complies with software security testing protocols
* Write secure communications through the application of current encryption technologies and techniques
